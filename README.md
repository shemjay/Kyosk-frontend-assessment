## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

- This is my first time ever using AngularJS. Ive learned how to use Angular components, services, routes, API calls and context.
- How to use Tailwind v4 with Angular 19+. There were a few hiccups setting it up.

### Continued development

- Angular service workers
- Angular testing
- Making API calls with Angular JS
- Managing state in Angular and services

### Useful resources

- [AngularJS Crash course video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUmVFHlwZsI&ab_channel=CodewithAhsan) - This helped me learn the basics of angular. Tutorials on Angular are quite few
  on YouTube so it was nice to find a relatively short but understandable one.
- [AngularDocsTutorials](https://angular.dev/tutorials) - The official docs of Angular have up to date simple tutorials
